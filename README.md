# cfc_color_lib
Color Library for CFC

# Usage

Usage is extremely simple. Here's an example:
```lua
local colors = CFCColors

LocalPlayer():SetColor(colors.GREEN)
```

Please read the main file in `lua/autorun/server/sv_cfc_colors.moon` to get a good idea of what colors you can use.

We use the default CSS Colors list, if that means anything to you :)
